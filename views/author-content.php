                        <h4>I am a student of ICT College, University in Belgrade. At the moment, I'm attending the second year of the studies and so far chances for me graduating it in a time predicted for this program are pretty good. About my personal characteristics I would choose laziness as one of the main, but when it comes to work and when there's a great reason for it, I'm hardworking and someone who doesn't give up easily. A few hundreds of euros per month seems like a good reason to me (i accept dollars too). So if you have some extra cash and need a responsible and dedicated web developer, we could be a perfect match! </h4>
